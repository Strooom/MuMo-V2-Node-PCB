# Improvements for V2.1

1. provide solder pad to disable battery charger when eg using AA Alkaline cells. SW should somehow be able to know this
2. maybe use different SMA connector so antenna comes more into the center of the enclosure. Now it comes quite close to the front. To be assessed with actual antennas
6. should antenna connector be in the SMD stencil ? I think it will be hand-soldered
9. move writeProtect (PA0) to another pin, as this pin has wakeup capabilities ? Maybe it's more suited to wakeUp on USB power - check in firmware
10. fix stencil for SMA connector
